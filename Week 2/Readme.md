# Week 2

 1. Which information is needed to create a virtual private cloud (VPC)?

        The AWS Region that the VPC will reside in.

 2. Which of the following can a route table be attached to?

         Subnets

 3. A company wants to allow resources in a public subnet to communicate with the internet. Which of the following must the company do to meet this requirement?

         B and C

 4. What is the compute as a service (CaaS) model?

         The CaaS model offers computing resources (such as virtual machines that run on servers in data centers) on demand, by using virtual services.

 5. Which statement about the default settings of a security group is TRUE?

         Blocks all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic by default.

 6. What does an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance type indicate?

         Instance family and instance size

 7. What is the relationship between Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances?

         An AMI is a template that contains the software that is required to launch an instance. EC2 instances are live instantiations of what is defined in an AMI, much like a cake is a live instantiation of a cake recipe.

 8. What is the difference between using AWS Fargate or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) as the compute platform for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)?

        With AWS Fargate, AWS manages and provisions the underlying infrastructure for hosting containers.

 9. Which statement about serverless is TRUE?

         Users do not pay for idle resources.

 10. True or False: AWS Lambda is always the best solution when running applications on AWS.

         False

 11. Which compute service does Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provide?

         Virtual machines (VMs)

 12. Which stage of the instance lifecycle is an instance in when the account starts to accumulate charges?

         When an instance is in a running stage

 13. Which component of the c5.4xlarge instance determines the instance family and generation number?

         c5

 14. Which container runtime can be used to host a container on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance?

         Docker

 15. What is an example of an event that invokes an AWS Lambda function?

      
         An upload of a file to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) source bucket

 16. True or False: With serverless, users do not need to provision and manage servers.

         True

 17. True or False: All AWS services require users to configure a virtual private cloud (VPC).

         False

 18. An engineer is working with networks in the AWS Cloud. What should the engineer use to configure the size of their network?

         Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation

 19. What is the difference between network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups?

         By default, network ACLs allow incoming and outgoing traffic from a subnet. Users can change these settings to provide an additional layer of security. However, the default configurations of security groups block all inbound traffic and allow all outbound traffic.
